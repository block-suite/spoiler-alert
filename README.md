# Stop Ruining Things
The internet is a wonderful but terrible place. Don’t make it any worse by ruining things for people. Seriously, let’s try to clean up the internet and make it a better place. 

This can be used in the classic sense which is talking about a movie/tv show/book but giving people a heads up that if they haven’t seen or read it yet they may not want to read on.

# Not just for text
Spoiler alert works on not only the paragraph block but also the image one.

# But, There’s More
The only limit on how you use Spoiler Alert is your imagination. 

- What if you are writing a gender reveal post and you want to add a little suspense by hiding the image that reveals the gender.  ..  
- What if you are putting out some content that you think it a little mature and you want to make sure people are really sure that they are ready to read it.
- What if you are making a quiz and you don’t want people accidentally reading the answers before they’ve made their guess.
